To build the library use the command:

$ sbt assembly

This will build a single jar file that can be used for connecting to RabbitMQ

To add the library as dependency add following line to your dependencies list in the build.sbt script
  "com.blinkboxbooks.hermes"          %% "rabbitmq-ha"                 % "1.0.0"
